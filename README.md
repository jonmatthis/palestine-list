#### ⭐SPOTLIGHT:

* **Released:** Jan 12, 2024
* **Length:** 1h06m
* **Where:** [Free on YouTube](https://www.gazaisourhome.com/#watch)
* **Description: **When Monear Shaer first started making a slideshow about his Palestinian family, he thought he was highlighting the beauty of life in Gaza. But when the onslaught of the 2023 invasion developed, it became imperative that the true reality and first hand experience of life in his family’s homeland is shown to the world. Monear’s first feature-length documentary shows just a few of the millions of heartbreaking injustices that have been occurring over the last several decades.

## BOOKS

#### The Big Three (with runners up):

##### ⭐[The 100 Years&#39; War on Palestine](https://bookshop.org/a/104178/9781250787651) by Rashid Khalidi (2020)

* A seminal work that offers a comprehensive and deeply personal account of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from the perspective of a distinguished historian and descendant of Palestinian Arab families. Khalidi frames the conflict as a century-long war against the Palestinian people, initiated by external forces with the aim of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. This narrative challenges conventional historiography by focusing on the experiences and perspectives of Palestinians, providing insights into the systemic efforts to displace, dispossess, and marginalize them over the course of a century.
* Runners up by Rashid Khalidi: **[Palestinian Identity](https://www.abebooks.com/Palestinian-Identity-Khalidi-Rashid-Columbia-University/31184383467/bd) (1997), [The Iron Cage](https://www.beacon.org/The-Iron-Cage-P669.aspx) (2006), [Brokers of Deceit](https://www.beacon.org/Brokers-of-Deceit-P1029.aspx) (2013)**. An unofficial trilogy of works on Palestinian history, politics, and struggle for identity. Khalidi, a distinguished historian and professor, weaves together historical documents, personal stories, and political analysis to present a nuanced perspective on Palestinian nationalism, the obstacles to statehood, and the external influences that have shaped the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. From the late Ottoman period to the present day, these works collectively trace the evolution of Palestinian identity, the entrapments of colonial and post-colonial power dynamics, and the role of international diplomacy in the ongoing quest for peace in the Middle East.

##### ⭐[The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine](https://bookshop.org/a/104178/9781851685554) by Ilan Pappé (2006)

* A groundbreaking work that offers a comprehensive and critical analysis of the events leading up to and following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a period that saw the mass displacement of Palestinian Arabs. Pappé, an Israeli historian and a senior lecturer at the University of Haifa at the time of publication, uses a wide array of sources, including newly declassified Israeli military archives and personal diaries, to show how the flight of over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs was the result of a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing orchestrated by Zionist leaders.
* Runner up by Ilan Pappé: **[Ten Myths About Israel](https://bookshop.org/p/books/ten-myths-about-israel-ilan-pappe/12020111?ean=9781786630193) (2017) **addresses the following myths:** 
  **1. Palestine was an empty land 
  2. The Jews were a people without a land 
  3. Zionism is Judaism 
  4. Zionism is not colonialism 
  5. The Palestinians voluntarily left their homeland in 1948 
  6. The June 1967 war was a war of ‘No Choice’ 
  7. Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East 
  8. The Oslo Mythologies 
  9. The Gaza Mythologies 
  10. The Two-States Solution is the only way forward

##### ⭐[Palestine: A Four Thousand Year History](https://bookshop.org/a/104178/9780755649426) by Nur Masalha (2018)

* A comprehensive and scholarly exploration of the history of Palestine, stretching from the ancient past to the modern era. Masalha, a Palestinian historian, challenges conventional narratives that often begin the history of Palestine with the Roman Empire or the advent of Zionism, or limit it to the narrow confines of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead, he presents a deep historical account that underscores the rich and continuous presence of indigenous cultures, peoples, and civilizations in Palestine over millennia.
* Runner up by Nur Masalha: [The Palestine Nakba Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern, Reclaiming Memory](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-palestine-nakba-decolonising-history-narrating-the-subaltern-reclaiming-memory_nur-masalha/14072841/#edition=14916459&idiq=26308336) (2012). Explores “social history from below”, subaltern narratives of memory and the formation of collective identity. Masalha argues that to write more truthfully about the Nakba is not just to practise a professional historiography but an ethical imperative. The struggles of ordinary refugees to recover and publicly assert the truth about the Nakba is a vital way of protecting their rights and keeping the hope for peace with justice alive.
